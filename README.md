# Network Port Query (Paramiko)
The purpose of this script is to return the switch ip, port location, and vlan number of a particular device mac address in a Dictionary format.

Use case: (In my case) I can use this information to have another script change the VLAN number on the device to perform automatic loads (in a VLAN-based work enviroment).
